My name is Stas Sajin and I currently reside in Sacramento, CA. I finished my PhD in Cognitive and Brain Sciences, which is to say that I studied how human brains process and understand information. During my PhD years, I focused on finding out how listeners process accented speech, how they integrate visual and spoken information, how they learn the meaning of new words, how to more sparsely represent the structure of language, and how working memory affects the way we process the world around us. My graduate career has given me a ton of experience in running behavioral studies, asking relevant research questions, and statistics.    

I'm also a [CFA Candidate](https://www.cfainstitute.org/programs/cfaprogram/Pages/index.aspx) (I've cleared all three levels), have a Bachelors in Business Administration, and a very deep interest in mathematics and finance, particularly fin-tech. On this blog, I will generally post projects related to the financial sector with occasional non-finance projects that pique my interest. If you want me to cover a particular topic, you can send me a message through LinkedIn.

I hope that with my background in cognitive science, statistics, and finance to transition to a job that helps clients and organizations make better organizational or investment decisions. 

I enjoy running, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9936201-stas-sajin), and motorcycle camping trips.
