This blog has been created in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [github-pages](https://pages.github.com/), markdown, and a bunch of js libraries (e.g., plotly, d3) to make things look nice and pretty. I'm also using the [So Simple Theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) by Michael Ross. I strongly believe in sharing knowledge and insights with the community, so you can find all the code I post on my website [here](https://github.com/stasSajin).
